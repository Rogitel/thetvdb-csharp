		<Overview>
			Most people think of Charlie Jones and Merlin Olsen for their contributions to football (Jones as a broadcaster, Olsen as a Hall of Fame defensive tackle).  Indeed, NBC sometimes paired them for NFL broadcasts.  But one other thing Charlie and Merlin share is a fascination for the Old West. In the mid-1980s, they researched the Old West and put together The American Frontier, a series of short videos for American public television.  Some of these shorts reveal the truth about things we seem to know, such as the California Gold Rush and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  Other programs delve into some of the people whose deeds are sometimes forgotten in today's world.  Among that latter category was Horace Tabor (pictured), who had cornered the silver market in Colorado in the 1880s. Please note:
			The American Frontier was originally produced as filler material to absorb the three to nine minutes between PBS shows.  Technically, this means there was no particular order of the

		<Overview>
			Since 1988, PBS has broadcast a series that focuses on the history of the United States and what has made it unique. Called The American Experience (now shortened to simply American Experience), the program examines the people, events, technology, and natural resources that have shaped the country. Hosted by David McCullough until 2002 and narrated by a number of well-known personalities - The American Experience uses historians and authors, period images and film, music, dramatic re-enactments, and contemporary context to set the stage for its topics.

			The series continues to this day with a variable number of installments produced each year. Episodes are generally 60 minutes in length, but some longer episodes and multi-part series have also been produced. The show airs at different days and times on local PBS stations.

			Though The American Experience has used many films from independent film makers and has been assisted by various PBS stations throughout the country, it has always been spearheaded by WGBH in Boston.

		<Overview>
			A special-ed teacher, an FBI agent, and a UFO? That's right, you've guessed it------- The Greatest American Hero. This show was first aired in 1981, and was both a comedy and a drama. A special "power suit" that only works on him is given to the teacher by the aliens, and he is paired up with the gumshoe FBI agent who keeps them both busy with his scenarios. The suit of "unearthly powers" gives the power of strength, flight, invisibilty, flames, telekenesis, vision of events without being there, protection from bullets and fire (if he remembers to cover his head!), and some others that he must figure out as well because; HE LOST THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT CAME WITH THE SUIT! Intro Theme:
			Look at what's happened to me
			I can't believe it myself
			Suddenly I'm up on top of the world
			It should have been somebody else Believe it or not I'm walking on air
			I never thought I could feel so free
			Flying away on a wing and a prayer
			Who could it be?
			Believe it or not it's just me
