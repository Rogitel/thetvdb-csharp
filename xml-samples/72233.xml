  <Overview>What would you do if you could relive a day? If you're TRU DAVIES (Eliza Dushku), you'd save lives. Tru is a smart and sexy recent college graduate who - when her high-powered medical internship falls through - finds herself working the midnight shift at the city morgue. One night, Tru questions reality when she thinks she hears a murder victim asking for her help. But the next morning, our heroine wakes up to find that she is back at the beginning of that very same day - twelve hours before a death that only she knows about is set to take place. Now with the clock ticking, Tru is compelled to traverse the city over the next twelve hours to try to prevent this tragedy, while at the same time trying to rescue members of her own family from their dangerous and self-destructive lives. With the sexiness and speed of &quot;Run Lola Run,&quot; plus the ticking clock suspense of 24 , Tru Calling puts a stylish new spin on the procedural crime format as Tru uses her newfound ability to try to stop tragedies before they actually happen. In the series, Tru is surrounded by HARRISON (Shawn Reaves), her handsome and charming younger brother who has a knack for finding trouble; MEREDITH (Jessica Collins), their older sister who has a great career and money, but battles drug addiction; LINDSAY (A.J. Cook), Tru's loyal but unsuspecting best friend; and DAVIS (Zach Galifianakis), the quirky morgue staffer Tru works with on the graveyard shift. In the middle of the first season, we were introduced to a new character named Jack Harper(Jason Priestly), who plays a new morgue attendent, who seems to have a strange effect on Tru's abilities when he's around. Tru discovers that he also has the power to go back in time...only he is her true universal opposite, which means he wants the people to STAY dead... The pilot episode was directed by renowned filmmaker Phillip Noyce. Tru Calling is a production of 20th Century Fox Television and Original Film and was created by executive producer/writer Jon Harmon Feldman. Marty Adelstein, Neal Moritz, Dawn Parouse and R. W. (Bob) Goodwin are also executive producers.
