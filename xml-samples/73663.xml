As the men prepare for Battle, a funny thing happens and Ray is finally able to tell Frank that he wishes they did more together. So, although Frank's on the side of the North and Raymond's on the side of the South, the Barone soldiers are able to put their political differences aside and share much more than a Civil War handshake.</Overview>

But apparently the unmarried Sarina has taken &quot;&quot;stop by if you're ever in America&quot;&quot; a little too literally and shows up at the front door. Her American family instantly adores her for her way with pizza and old world charm. Ray, as always, thinks it's too good to be true and he's right.</Overview>

  <Overview>When Debra's mother comes to visit the family for a week, Debra finds herself shocked to discover that she wishes her mom were more like Marie. Debra's highly anticipated week of &quot;&quot;quality time&quot;&quot; with her mom, Lois, and the family quickly turns into a big disappointment when her mother seems more interested in the Renoir exhibit and her crossword puzzles than in Debra, Ray and the children. When her frustration with Lois' disinterest reaches a boiling point, Debra makes the mistake of blurting out that she wishes her mother were more like Marie. Then she has the unfortunate double trouble of making amends with her mom -- and dealing not only with Marie's glee, but also with her claim that she deserves credit for teaching Debra parenting skills.</Overview>

  <Overview>Ray and Debra have differing points of view on how best to handle the situation when they learn that Ally has been bullying another child on the school bus. Ray thinks Ally's pushiness and &quot;&quot;don't take any crap from anyone&quot;&quot; attitude comes from Debra. Meanwhile, Debra thinks if she doesn't instill that independence in Ally, she'll end up being a wuss - just like her dad. But, when push comes to shove and they confront Ally about how to better her behavior, they find themselves questioning their own parenting abilities.</Overview>

No one realized how much of an effect the &quot;&quot;bull incident&quot;&quot; had on Robert's mental state â€“ and his ability to confront fear and the unexpected.

  <Overview>Robert finds himself in the most unlikely position of having to choose one of three women â€“ girlfriend Amy, ex-wife Joanne or Italian bombshell Stefania â€“ to share the future with him. Robert decides that &quot;&quot;honesty is the best policy&quot;&quot; when it comes to his relationship with Amy, so he foolishly tells her about his recent reunion with ex-wife Joanne. To make matters worse, when Amy runs to Debra for consolation, Debra mistakenly spills the beans about Robert's recent tryst with Stefania. Suddenly, Robert is not in a position to decide which woman he wants. It's a matter of which one, if any, is going to want him.</Overview>

  <Overview>Ray inadvertently commits &quot;&quot;petslaughter&quot;&quot; on Ally's hamster while Debra and the kids are away for the weekend. When Ray breaks the difficult news to Ally about &quot;&quot;Pumpernickel's&quot;&quot; untimely demise, Debra insists that they give the beloved pet a proper burial -- complete with eulogies -- to help the youngster get through the grieving process. What Ray at first thought was an utterly ridiculous way to mourn the passing of a family pet, ends up being one of the most emotional experiences of his life.</Overview>

  <Overview>The competition for attention between Ray and Robert reaches an all-time high with the brothers ending up in a fight. Ray's dreams of authoring a sports book get squashed when the publishing company takes a pass on it, just as Robert receives the good news that he is being promoted to lieutenant. The Barone family doesn't quite know how to react to this most bizarre of situations in which Ray has failed at something while Robert has succeeded. But worst of all, Ray doesn't know how (or if) he's ever going to get past this.</Overview>

But, when things come to a head at the Thanksgiving table, it's apparent that there really isn't that much of a difference between the two older couples â€“ much to Debra's dismay.</Overview>

  <Overview>When Ray realizes that his kids would rather spend time with their Uncle Robert than with him, he decides to do something about the situation. When Robert makes the observation that, as a parent, Ray finds it boring to be around his kids, Debra couldn't agree more. She then suggests that Ray follow Robert's example and to try to have more fun with his children. But, when her own parenting skills are called into question by Marie, Debra quickly changes her tune and rallies behind Ray, insisting that they are both very involved parents.</Overview>

  <Overview>As Ray escorts Ally to a father-daughter dance, he realizes how grown up and independent his daughter has become. As a result, he begins to recall the day, nine years ago, when the Barone clan welcomed her into the family, but not without incident. In the flashback, expectant parents Ray and Debra are caught by surprise when Debra goes into labor in the back seat of Robert's patrol car, forcing him to be called into action. Meanwhile, Ray and Debra plot to keep a pushy Marie away from the delivery room until after the baby is born, not an easy feat.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Barones clash even more than usual in the sixth-season opener when they get a child's-eye view of all the bickering that goes on in the family. The fireworks begin when the whole gang attends an open house at first-grader Michael's school, during which the kids all read stories that they've written themselves. Most of the students tell tall tales that are obviously fictional. But then Michael gets up and reads the title to his story, &quot;&quot;The Angry Family.&quot;&quot; The shocked Barones fear the worst---and for good reason---as Michael begins the saga of a clan that is constantly arguing.</Overview>

  <Overview>The six-year on-again, off-again relationship between Robert (Brad Garrett) and Amy (Monica Horan) is definitely on again in this pivotal episode. So much so, in fact, that &quot;&quot;Robert wants to propose to Amy,&quot;&quot; says executive producer Philip Rosenthal. But there's one formality the hopeful groom-to-be must take care of first: asking Amy's devout churchgoing folks (Fred Willard, Georgia Engel) for their daughter's hand in marriage. To that end, &quot;&quot;Robert convinces Ray to accompany him to meet her parents in [Pennsylvania],&quot;&quot; says Rosenthal. How they---and possibly Amy---respond determines whether wedding bells will be ringing anytime soon. Peter: Chris Elliott. Frank: Peter Boyle.</Overview>

  <Overview>Yet another bump appears on the rocky road to Robert and Amy's wedding, which was nearly blocked by her disapproving parents.   When the bride-to-be (Monica Horan) puts her betrothed (Brad Garrett) in charge of writing the wedding invitation, he seeks input from Ray and Frank. While they can't believe Robert let himself get roped into such a chore, they nevertheless come up with a plan: If Robert makes a mess of the job, it will convince Amy that she should take care of all the wedding plans herself. So the groom drafts an appalling mock invite---complete with the wrong date and names---and waits for Amy's reply...which is worse than he ever expected.</Overview>

  <Overview>Debra complains to Raymond about leaving things around the house. Later on, when Raymond receives a personal letter from his idol, Muhammad Ali, he remembers what Debra told him, so he puts it away in a drawer. Unfortunately, when Debra later looks for a coupon in the same drawer, she's so put off by how much 'junk' is in there, she indiscriminately dumps most of its contents into the trash - and then dumps the trash into a garbage truck just as it arrives. When Debra realizes her mistake, she goes to Marie, desperate for help. Marie takes the blame, but Debra soon finds out that Marie, as always, has ulterior motives.</Overview>

  <Overview>Ray fears getting his adenoids removed, but Debra convinces him to go through with the surgery.  At the hospital, while Marie is in the bathroom, the nurse says that Ray isn't waking up from the anesthesia and everyone fears he may die.  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, the doctor comes out and says he's just fine.  Everyone agrees not to tell Ray or Marie about it; however, Frank ends up telling Marie who rushes over to smother Ray with kisses.  Ray finds out about it and begins acting weird as if he thinks he really is going to die.  After a couple minutes, he gets out of it.  The show closes with the entire family sitting around the table eating and arguing, just like the Barones always have in the past nine years.</Overview>
